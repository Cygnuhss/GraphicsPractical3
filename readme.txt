Yoni Groosman 	- 4101421
Jelmer van Nuss - 4058925

-------------------------
------- Teamwork --------
-------------------------

Most of the work was done together, either in real life or through internet
communication. Jelmer did slightly more work on assignments 1.1, 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3
due to personal circumstances of Yoni. Yoni will make up for that in the next
assignment, and the division of labor did not come across as unfair.
Jelmer implemented the bonus assignment 4.1 on his own, out of curiosity.
